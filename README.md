# The Moon

I was looking for a simple way to know the current illumination of the Moon, but most apps provided too much data on the screen, along with annoying ads. So, I decided to create a clean and ad-free solution myself. My app provides just what I need â€“ the current Moon's illumination and phase, without any clutter or distractions.
